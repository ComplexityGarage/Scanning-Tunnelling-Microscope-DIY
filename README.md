# Description of the project 
Scanning tunneling Microscope is a tool capable of imaging surfaces with atomic resolution in the air. The STM is based on concept of quantum tunneling effect.

The microscope wokrs in two operating modes:
- Constant height mode
- Constant current mode

# What next?
The current version of microscope works in constant height mode. It could be developed by software modifications. Introducing a feedback loop which controls the voltage applied to the Z-axis electrode of the piezo scanner to maintain a constant tunneling current, allows it to operate in constant current mode. To provide better quality images, the noise could be reduced by building soundproof box.
